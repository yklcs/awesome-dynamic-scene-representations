# Awesome Dynamic Scene Representations

A curated list of resources on dynamic scene representations.

## What are dynamic scene representations?

Dynamic scene representations (aka 4D scene representations) encode the time-variant properties of a three-dimensional scene.
They can be viewed as the 4D extension of 3D scene representations, adding time into 3D methods such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian splatting.
This allows dynamic scene representations to synthesize and render novel views of scenes from sparse video inputs.
